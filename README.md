# Figure

Figure creates an asset pipeline for using your Figma files. 

Deploy your own copy of Figure on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), and it will give you always-updated URLs for all the Frames in your Figma file. 

You no longer have to export and update assets every time they change. Just rebuild the Netlify deployment to pull in new assets and keep using the same URL to the asset.
